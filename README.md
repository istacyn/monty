The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files. 
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes.

Monty ByteCode instructions operate on a stack and a heap. The stack is used for operations such as pushing and popping values, while the heap is used for storing variables. We will need to define appropriate data structures to implement the stack and heap.

We will need to write code to read the Monty ByteCode file, parse the instructions, and store them in a data structure.

We thwn implement the Interpreter by writing code to execute each instruction in the Monty ByteCode file.
